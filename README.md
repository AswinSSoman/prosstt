### PROSSTT

PROSSTT (PRObabilistic Simulations of ScRNA-seq Tree-like Topologies) is a package with code for the simulation of scRNAseq data for dynamic processes such as cell differentiation. PROSSTT is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in Python.

Single-cell RNAseq is revolutionizing cellular biology, and many algorithms are developed for the analysis of scRNAseq data. PROSSTT provides an easy way to test the performance of trajectory inference methods on realistic data with a known "gold standard". The algorithm can produce datasets with arbitrary topologies while simulating an arbitrary number of sampled cells and genes.

### Installation

PROSSTT can be installed using the `pip` package manager or any `pip`-compatible package manager:

	git clone https://github.com/soedinglab/prosstt.git
	cd prosstt
	pip install .

PROSSTT needs the `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries.
